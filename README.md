# Biostatistics Summer Prep Course: Methods & Computing

This course consisted of nine 90-minute sessions to prepare incoming biostatistics students for their statistical methods course. The contents available here include slide sets that introduce fundamental statistical topics and exercises for students to gain practice both applying these methods and computing in R. 

### Flow control 
- **Description**: practice with for and while loops, the apply family, and conditional statements in R
- [Exercises](exercises/2018_Lecture2_Exercises.pdf)
- [Solutions](solutions/2018_Lecture2_Solutions.pdf)

### Probability distributions

- **Description**:  overview of discrete and continuous probability distributions; expectation and variance of random variables; empirical cdfs; working with built-in probability distributions in R
- [Slides](slides/Lecture_3/2018_Lecture_03.pdf)
- [Exercises](exercises/2018_Lecture3_Exercises.pdf)
